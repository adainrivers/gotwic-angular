### Everyday use
- When you want to spend the gifts, follow the steps below:
  1. Look at your gifts and determine which gift you are gonna use.
  2. In the calculator and find the section relevant to the gift you are gonna use.
  3. The **commander with the highest value** next to him benefits most from that gift.
  4. After using the gift(s), if the level of the commander changed, update that commander's level in the calculator.
  5. Repeat steps 1 to 4 for all the gifts you have.

## What are the 'Weights'
Weights are the way for you to customize the calculation which determines the best commander per gift. 

For example, if you are on the path of unlocking T4s, you would need a lot of speedups and gold, therefore you should prioritize Aptitude and Finance over the rest. In that case you should put higher values to these two weights than the other three.

Another example, if you already have your T4s unlocked and you are looking for more PvP power, you should prioritize Combat much more over all other stats, followed by Leadership, Combat and Aptitude. At this point, you might even skip finance by setting it's value to 0.
